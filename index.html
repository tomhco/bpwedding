                <p>
                    Croeso! Welcome to our wedding website! We are so excited to spend our big day with you! We will send formal invitations in due course, however we will also be adding additional information to this website to hopefully make your trip to North Wales a
                    bit easier! A lot of people have asked us ‘why North Wales’? Since we have been together, Snowdonia has been a very special place for us; we would go as far as saying it is our second home! We have shared so many adventures together
                    up in the mountains, one of them being the sunny day in October that Pete surprised Beth mid-walk with an engagement ring at Cwm Idwal (you may recognise it from the Save The Dates)! Beth isn’t the best at walking down hills at the
                    best of times (she blames it on the fact she has short legs) but she definitely took a lot longer getting down that day as she half-cried, half-laughed her way back to the car post-proposal! In short, Snowdonia was really the only
                    place that we could imagine getting married and we hope to one day settle there in our own little house in the hills.

            <h1>The Ceremony</h1>
            <p>
                The wedding ceremony will take place at 1100 at Saint Peris in the parish of Bro Eyri. The Church sits at the foot of Snowdon in the hamlet of Nant Peris. It is approximately 2 miles from the town of Llanberis. From Llanberis, drive slowly through Nant
                Peris and you will see the Church tucked behind the Vaynol Arms Pub on the right hand side.

                There are a few parking spaces in front of the Church, however the car park is also used by Snowdonia Mountain Rescue therefore please do not block in their landrovers. Alternatively there is a large car park (£2.50 for 4 hours) situated only a few hundred
                feet down the road (LL55 4UF).

            <h1>Places To Stay</h1>
            <p>
                There are a range of different places to stay in the local area, ranging from hotels, B&Bs and even campsites if you have a nice warm tent! We also recommend checking out <a href=" https://www.airbnb.co.uk">Airbnb</a> – we frequently use the service and have stayed in some beautiful cottages/cabins
                in the area. Just pop Caer Rhun’s postcode into the search bar and quite a few properties appear. If you have never used the service, send us an email ASAP and we can send you a discount code!

                Normal wedding dress code, however remember it is in North Wales and therefore it is very likely that it will rain or get nippy at some point during the day, so make sure you have an umbrella (or full wet weather gear if you are feeling keen)! We also
                suggest bringing your walking boots along with you – do not fear, we aren’t dragging you up any mountains on the big day! We just think a visit to Snowdonia is not complete without a good yomp and we hope you are able to make the most
                of the beautiful scenery during your weekend!
